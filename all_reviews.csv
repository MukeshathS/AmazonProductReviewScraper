  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost..., Pros., 1) good features considering cost 6800., 2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt, 3) Speakers are good Dolby, 4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones..., 5) Quad camera gives good quality photos..., 6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800, 7) 5000mAh battery, 8) can be use as power bank for other phones, Cons:, 1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so..., 2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box..., This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,, Review score (out of 5), Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too..., Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor), Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good., Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days., Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours), Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is available, Pros : apart from above mentioned points :, 1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung), 2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range., 3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly, 4)face detection is fast, 5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming, 6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal uses, Cons:, 1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high, 2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option, 3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro, 4) no fast charger with pack

  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras..., But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020..., Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos.., Thanks Oppo

  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge

  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?

  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device

  Pros- Phone looks actually good,   Good battery life, Cons- phone is too heavy,   Camera performance not upto the,   mark., Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

  Guys I got this phone with exchange of my MiA1 only RS. 6200, Review giving after using this phone for 15 days., Pros:, 1. Bettery backup is superb.  I have to charge it alternate days., 2. Display is awesome, 3. Camera quality is good but you must have the knowledge of lighting to take awesome pictures., 4. RAM 4gb and ROM 64gb is quite good for normal use, 5. Face recognition is very fast., Cons:, 1. Camera is not good for those who don't understand the lighting position. Only those user complain about it., 2. Pattern lock is not available, you have to satisfied with face lock or numeric lock., 3. Weight around 200gms., Overall a good phone with exchange and it will never disappoint you. Trust me.

  OPPO A5: This is faulty product selling by Amazon. and they have shake hand with the the agent to fool customer., The camera quality of this mobile is worst and regarding this on 3rd day itself i wanted to return the product but Amazon has denied it saying its not their fault and product is not manufactured by them. But if the product is not manufactured by them and the product is faulty then they shall take return of the product and should return my money back. But Amazon executive is not taking the request of return for this product. this is straight away fooling the customer by Amazon.

"
   So the mobile was delivered to me on 20July,20 & the fingerprint scanner stopped working on 11Aug,20 ie less than a month ai it's within one month of purchase the scanner stopped working & if anyone is concerned I have already tried hard reset, soft reset of the handset but the scanner never worked as you can see in the video attached moreover they are still installing the bloatware eg helo app (as seen in the screen shot) which have been BANNED... by the Indian Government.. its not a small issue.. as they are still not working for the safety of there Indian customer... Thus never going to recommend a oppo mobile to anyone not even entry level & just forget about the high-end series...

"
  It's a nice phone , quite heavy that might be due to it's 5000mah battery. Gaaming is awesome , camera is not upto the mark, quad camera is just locha, night mode doesn't satisfy you,, And the most important thing it lacks is the LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT it's a must and seeing it's price (13k) notification light must have arranged,, I bought this phone in exchange don't buy it without exchange because you can get a much better phone in this price . nest with exchange

  phone is perfect & nice but i got a defective charger...kindly replace the charger, even after the complaint they are saying it will not be replaced..because the product is out of stock. why ?, its your mistake not mine.
"
"
  It's a great product to have in this price range. Very sturdy design and comes with very good quality back cover. It really protect the phone when falls down., Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently., Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day., Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all., I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product. It has blue light filters do saves your child's eye sights.

  I exchanged this for my Redmi Note 4. All said and done, I think, I shouldn't have. The Redmi Note (4 or any other version since) is superior in every way - scores over the Oppo in both departments  - hardware and software. I would have bought the new Redmi 9 but it wasn't available for exchange and I wasn't about to pay 4000 more. Besides there is the Redmi 9 and then there is a Redmi Note 9 and both offerings use the Mediatek processor, this time over, if I am not mistaken, instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon, and it is early days yet - with the reviews. They say some flavors of the Mediatek are doing as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon, but I can't be sure and you might want to look up the data on that elsewhere - say NDTV gadgets or some such site., The Oppo's operating system ""Color OS"" sucks big time. Among other annoyances the most visible / obvious ones are : you don't get that slider to get past the screen saver, and you have to punch in your security numbers every time - which is a bit of a pain and also they want you to pay them anything in between 24 to a couple of hundred bucks for a new theme, which you can get on other phones for free (or at least I did with Redmi). Who in their right mind will pay for kitschy wallpaper and cheap fonts from when windows was launched in 1985 (you know the type that was included in all kinds of ""banner"" software and then made it's way into software like wordstar? that). Also, from day one, the ""assistive ball"" is missing for me. I would use the assistive ball to take screenshots or the one-touch turn off display button. I tried to reach oppo customer service about it. try as I might, i couldn't call them and then I found an email id and tried to write to them, but they didn't have an answer either. The best they could do is ask me to reset the OS all over again - which of course I am not going to do. It would mean downloading and installing all the apps again. And if it still doesn't correct the problem, I'd have lost all that valuable bandwidth for nothing. Also, it would reset some of the bloatware I got rid off, so painstakingly.  I can always use the system one touch turn off display icon from the tray. But shiver me timbers! if I ever need to reach them about a genuine SOS kinda issue, then what?!, -------------------------, Edit: I have upgraded to Android 10 (the phone I bought shipped with Android 9), and it has a bar on the side instead of the ""assistive ball"", with a few essential tools, much like in Android 9. So, maybe, they have done away with the assistive ball feature altogether and the documentation didn't reflect that, and customer-service was none the wiser? Anyway, things are okay for the moment. The phone is functioning this far, except the finger biometric is not as quick on the draw as it was and I hope it isn't developing some kind of a glitch. At times, it is a little slow to respond and I have to use the button on the side to get the screen to open., --------------------------, The other thing that you miss when moving from the Redmi to this one is the Redmi OS's ""Second Space"" feature. The dual device mode (not the same as dual apps). It's like you have a laptop / PC with two operating systems to choose from only you can switch from one to the other when your phone is still on - fully booted up and while working on one OS. Like an alt + tab on the PC, switch from one ""space"" to the other and back again. Talk to the wife on the one end and exchange whatsapp with the girlfriend on the other (kidding. have neither a wife or a girlfriend! but think about those who do! what fun! yeah? they made a phone for adulterers!)., I tried to take a picture of the full moon at night the other evening, and all I got was white light in the frame! Now, the thing has four cameras, with goodness knows how many megapixels and it's been a while since smartphones have been at it - so, you'd think they might have the whole point-and-shoot thing in the bag, wouldn't you? At least don't dissolve a perfectly round moon into Jesus' second coming! Elsewhere I read, the OPPO isn't what you use for night photography, but it takes okay enough pictures during the day. But that's like shortchanging you 50 percent on the cameras. It's like they punched in four holes in the thing and stuck in a few lenses that don't do nothing ever for you, like a cheap Rolex knock-off that sits there on your wrist, but won't tell the time.  I don't use the camera, so I won't complain, but you don't want to buy the Oppo to take pictures then., I had a good mind of returning it and get my money back before the window closes but I don't want to go through the hassle all over again (of buying another phone). It works and I am able to use it to connect to the internet. I can only hope that the thing does not develop any snags going ahead and at least lasts me a few years before I can afford to buy me another phone!, so, yeah. underwhelmed. but on the plus side, i knocked Rs. 3500/- off of the marked price, got me a little more space (the old Redmi had 32GB and this one has 64, not that it makes a difference to me. A good chunk is taken away by the OS and leaves about 40 GB available to me for my apps, audio and ebooks) , and also I got me 4gb of RAM. That's a GB more and the good thing about that is I don't have to start the Amazon app again every time I go away googling for the answers to the Amazon quiz. (what? so I cheat! it's not like I have won anything ever or am ever gonna win anything anyway!)

  I am a normal phone user, so dont  like to play game in Phone and waste time., But want to give a honest review, 1) I have taken White colour Phone and its really looking great. I will suggest dont go for Black., 2) Camera Is good total 4+1 Lense are there , Selfie is also good but not up to the mark. but back camera is very good . We should expect DSLR quality from Phone camera so My rating is 4., 3) Charging is quite good and fast ., 4) Company is providing back cover and earphone so it saves Rs.500/- Earphone sound is very good and soft., 5) Finger Sensor rating is 4, 6) Using since 24 Hours and not fell any lagging. Installed my Office application and its quit good and Fast., 7) Better than MI (Xiomi) because now these days MI comes in Sale and in few minutes it will finish , but I would recommend  for this no need to wait for sale and quite a good phone in this 12000/- range., 8) Delivery took less than 24 hours and I am not a prime member- Credit goes to Amazon., Cons, 1) Ring tone is little bit low

  I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user., one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that., but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming

  I bought this Phone and used 48 hr . Here I am sharing my review about this Phone, Prons, 1.value for money, 2.Battery back-up is very good in normal usages, 3.rear camera is decent but need to improve, 4.selfie camera is very good compared to other phones, 5.Display is Decent only., 6.inbuild tempered glass and transparent backcover is excellent quallity, 7.Dolby Atmos speaker's are excellent, 8.No heating issues on wifi,  Cons, 1.Power Adaptor (charger) is made in china.company itself says product is made in India and I don't know why they give china charger, 2.No Fast charging option.it takes 3hr minimum to 0 to 100, 3.There is no Led Notification indicator. This is the biggest drawbacks of this Phone because even 3000 rs phones comes with led notification indicator
"
"
  1. No wifi calling right out of the box but once you update it you get WiFi calling ., 2. Phone is heavy : my hands literally start to pain after few hours of use. Mainly chat., 3. Battery, display, camera is all fine. For this price range., 4. My biggest disappointment is weight., 5. After 4 months phone started getting hang sometime. Not too much but still.

  This phone is too good in battery life. If you like music there is awesome Dolby atmos system. Good fone in budget. Camera performance is also excellent in this budget category. Performance and Display is also good. You can play pubg without any lag and with excellent battery backup., Overall, good phone in this category
"
"
  Best if you get it under 10k. I got it on sale + exchange so the deal was fine for me., Display 3.5/5, Camera 2.5/5, Battery 5/5, Charging 3/5, Performance 3.5/5, No headsets for 3gb variant🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️, Fingerfrint is fast. I don't use face unlock. SD665 is great budget chipset. Updated to Android 10 but color os is just meh. I mean out for 3gb ram it uses 1.5gb, with some permanent services you are left with 1gb free memory. Bought it for my parents so no big deal as they are not heavy users but if you are a heavy user, either don't buy color os phone or atleast go for 4gb variants.
"
"
  So I bought this phone for my dad., Pricing is a bit high even for 3GB version. However I got it at 9,400 on sale so a pretty good deal., Pros:, 1. Big screen, 2. Widevine L1 certification, 3. Stereo speakers which are quite loud and great for such a cheap phone, 4. Dolby Atmos, 5. Two usable cameras incl. Ultra Wide, 6. 5000mah battery with type C charging (again quite rare at this price point), 7. Android 10 update (rare for entry level phones), Cons:, 1. Ultra wide camera is lackluster, 2. 10watt charging support only, 3. L1 certification is only for show as Netflix and Prime do not support the phone for HD streaming, If you are getting it sale then it is quite a good phone, but if not on sale then there are better options out there from Samsung, Realme and Redmi.

  First impressions - Beautiful ! Design and build - full marks.., This is my first Oppo experience. Bought it as a gift for a near one., It has all that you need! I haven't enabled the finger print sensor as its not needed as yet. Touch is as responsive as my OnePlus 6T I use.  Its just 2 days of use. Its just the perfect blend of features and great specs it already has. No lag whatsoever and this is the 3 GB version. No bloatware., What more can one want ? Overall Excellent VFM !

  Screen -, Screen quality is very veryy bad. After 30 minutes of continuously uses i have headache & pain in eye's., Let's talk about the processor -, Performance of Snapdragon 665 processor is very bad in this phone even my Redmi note 5 pro which is 2 years old & has Snapdragon 636 processor is perform better in Games especially in PUBG., Camera -, Both Cameras are decent, Gameplay -, When i start playing PUBG i experience a huge Lag problem & Continuously frame Drops even in very low Graphics ( So Smooth + Medium ). I wouldn't expect this type of performance., Performance in gaming is very Bad., Other -, The pre apllied Screen protector is very bad. It has 0% smoothness., The Sterio Speakers is not that laoud as other smartphone which has Sterio Speakers., Battery -, Battery life is ok but not as i expect. But the main problem is charging it takes approximately 2:30 - 3 hours to charge 100%. Charging speed is very slow. If you are in hurry or in emergency belive me this phone is Sucks & get cheated with you, Design -, Design is very good but the white colour became dull very easily., Accessories -, You get a 10w charger & usb type-C which is of  Poor quality., You only get earphone with 4gb model. with 3 gb model you  can't get earphones., Please Don't wasn't your money Here. Go somewhere else.

  I had never thought I would go for this phone., I had thought to buy redmi note 9 which went out of stock and I needed a phone urgently., Then finally I had to buy this. It is really amazing. I was not having good opinion about this phone , but its AMAZING., Camera: The rear camera performnace is realy amazing at this price point. Front camera performance is above average. I wouldnt recommend selfie lovers.The video stabalisation of rare camera is like other phone in price segmant like redmi note 8., Battery: The battery is the beast . It lasts a day smoothly after heavy use and may even remiain after that., Performance: Its good . I wouldnt say its best, But redmi note 9/note 8 is better in smoothness if compared. But its smooth., Pros(my point of view):, 1. Camera is outstanding for the price, 2. Speakers are extra loud and have good quality, 3. Screen is really large and colours pop out amazingly, 4. Fingerprint and face unlock are like flagship phones, 5. Design feels rich, 6. Phone feels light in hand, Cons:, 1. Front camera could be improved, 2.the speed of scrolling is a bit slow( Im not sure, i guess it can be fixed through settings), 3. Camera app could have more features like night mode

  Its camera quality is very very bad.., Problems which i am facing are-, 1. Heating issue, 2. unusual battery draining, 3. 3.5 mm port defective.,  There are so many smartphones available in this price segment..so please don't waste your money

"
  This phone has one of the best dual speakers available in the market, its loud and clear with dolby atmos., Display is 720 p but its bright and overall picture quality and sound effects are amazing., Processor sd 665 is nice too, you can play pub g and most of the heavy games on it with medium to high settings., Call quality, wifi receiver and every other aspect of this phone is nice for this budget. of 10 to 11 K., Whats not good with this phone is - battery Charging time !!!!!!! it takes 3hrs to charge from 0 to 100 with 10 watt charger. Discharge of battrey is good because of 11nm chipset so kinda helps in number of times you will charge., Canera quality is ok, not the best but does justice to the price., Definitely recommend it to others if you dont mind 2-3 hrs charging time.
"
"
  The phone is good but in 2020 you can get a better spec with the same budget. It can be any other Oppo or any other brand. But it won't disappoint you. The only bad is it's camera. Not that much good if you are a photoholic person. Otherwise it will satisfy you in every other aspect. Be it battery life or display or sound quality. No heating issue. Fingerprint sensor is excellent. Overall 3.5 star.

  If u want to buy a good phone in same price range ....check out others company products...it's almost gud but little costly and there is greater issue about system update...when u update , update complete upto 100% after using lot of internet..but phone not get updated & features remain same as before it is....It always give notification of new update is available..., I tried to get rid of this issue but it is in vain..and no any earphone is available with this phone.., I m just suggesting, if you are oppo lover then go for it only with exachange of mobile due to it costs u less, else I recommend not to buy the phone due to its issues with more cost...

  The phone is good in terms of battery life and memory only. Rest nothing is good about it. I received this on 13th August and writing review on 20th August. Here are the issues:, 1. The camera is very poor. It has too much noise and picture quality isn't good., 2. This phone doesn't support direct video calls. That's pathetic., 3. Phone gets heat up and the charger heats up more than that. I've shared a screenshot of 43°C but I've noticed the temperature going 45°C. If you are using online meeting apps like zoom, ms teams or Google meet, the heating is little faster. The worse part is that it gets up heated while calling which makes it highly uncomfortable to talk and even hold in hands., 4. Whatsapp notifications stuck on the screen for few seconds while watching online videos., 5. You can't see YouTube videos more than 480p, sometimes a few videos stream at 720p. Same videos run at 1080p on other devices., 6. The customer care executives aren't able to understand the problem. I've called 5 times since Sunday but they conduct and suggest the same solution for better performance of the phone but no improvements have been noticed. Yesterday I was convinced that Amazon has registered the problem and will get back to me but I'm waiting since yesterday afternoon and my query hasn't come yet., 7. Amazon fools you. It decreased its prices on 6-7 August for sale. I was happy that this product is available at a lower price but the decreased price has become fixed now. So whenever you see a sale, always buy electronic products after the sale is over and don't become a fool. I bought this item based on my friends recommendations (since I needed a phone urgently for my work) but I'm done buying any electronic products from Amazon.

  Oppo A5 2020 is good enough as per budget but operating system needs to be little more upgraded. Phone app/calling app is not user friendly.  It is same like redmi phone app. And gallery media files are arranged in a reverse dated rows means you will find media files like pics/videos from current dates at the bottom and very old dated at the top which is not convenient.  Rest all is fine.
"
"
  The phone built quality seems good with good finishing. Has a good camera. Audio quality is good. But the screen size is large and can be uncomfortable while riding a bike. Also, the audio jack is on the bottom side,so if you are an avid music listener the cable could bend a lot. For the price I paid I am very happy with the product as I have found the camera and the audio very good. The screen resolution could have been better though for the size of the screen used. Have shared few images shot on the phone. The video stabilisation also seems to be good.  Overall its a very good phone.

"
  I purchased this device for my father, who's priority is whatsapp and YouTube only with some step counting and calories burning counting apps. For that purpose this device is fine. But as it's having sd 665 ai processor I tested it with gameplay of freefire in low settings and device got hanged, with unbearable fluctuating FPS. I changed certain settings in developer options to make more ram free and bang performance of gaming improved drastically. This simply means this device has bad ram management and it really needs to ne worked out. I would suggest if you bare planning to buy this device with multitasking and gaming in mind than think twice, otherwise it's Ok to go for it.

  I purchased this phone only for Vowifi  calling as call drop was the major concern that too from all network provider in my lane and conditions worsens after entering the house. But Vowifi works inside also... So I purchased it for vowifi. Firstly I got annoyed as I didn't find the vowifi feature (though i checked in internet before purchasing) . But then there was a catch that only oppo 2020 having Color OS 7 have this feature and upgrades will be available for phones having build version ending with 48 and 51. This I came to know from Oppo customer care. Thankfully my phone was in list of updated ones and after updating it serves the purpose. Now I can make and receive calls even inside house. Weight Slightly on higher side but touch and camera are gud.

  I have been using phone almost one month. I am satisfied. This phone is more good that what I have expected. Starting with camera ,it is only a average camera not bad but has 4k video recording. Battery life is excellent. I am getting 11 plus hours ON screen usage. Then the most good part of the phone is it's speakers and finger print scanner. Screen is not full hd only 720p but it's good . Phones design is perfect. In my usage of 1 month I haven't felt any lag even when I played Pubg. I can't find any dark mode on this phone. In my first impression the phone was a bit heavy. But after usng it I am used to it. Overall a good phone for day to day use.

  Phone design look pretty cool and battery backup is amazing. Camera is decent but I'm not that  kind of  person who takes different, different, types of photos., If compare to price Oppo A5 2020 is expensive, I got the device at 13,990 rupees ( 4GB/64GB). At this price point they should give FHD+ display & fast charging, compare to competition.

  At price of rs 12000 it’s very poor in terms of its, 1touch screen. U need to press little hard on screen., 2 fast charging option is missing. Don’t not support fastcharger., 3 camera is very poor in its resolution. Chinese product claim just in terms of mega pixels but quality is just in half of the range of its claim., 4. Forget about HD+, It’s not even HD, Good aspects, 1 screen Size is good, 2 exchange offer is provided. Which is missing in readmi 9prime . Readmi much better in quality with 2000 less in price., I admit I have made bad choice. Do watch reviews on YouTube.

  I am writing this review after using it for 2 and a half months., I am having bad experience with this.  May be the seller has given me defective product since I  got it at a cheap price than market price., Problems facing:, 1- Fingerprint not working so went to care center,  they are rude and asking to keep the phone for a week for repair., 2-Earphones provided not working properly,  only 1 side working., 3- While talking on phone it automatically goes on hold or mute. Sensors not working properly., 4 - Screen sleep time gets change to 15 seconds everyday automatically. I need to change everyday to my setting., 5-  very bulky and heavy.., Please don't waste money to buy from this seller. Infact don't buy this product at all.

  I have been using this phone for around two weeks and following are the pros and cons I found of this device:, Pros, 1. Battery life is supperb, the HD plus  screen kind off consumes less power than a Full HD screen and hence battery life with a 5000 mah battery is really good., 2. Speaker and sound is absolutely best, dolby atmos is amazing to hear, there are two speakers on this phone., 3. Quad cameras, there are four of them in the rear and they take decent photos for this price range., 4. Android 10 update with dark mode looks awesome along with colorOS 7 UI., 5. Display is very good inspite of being only HD plus display., 6. Snapdragon 665 can run most games at medium settings without any problem., Cons, 1. No fast charge, it will take around 2 hours to fully charge this phone to 100% from 10%., 2. Screen resolution should have been Full HD and many of the completitors are offering it at this price., 3. Front camera not as good as you would expect despite being 8 mp.
"
"
  Good quality display even if its a HD+ display, Color OS 7 is a big improvement over its predecessor, UI is customizable according to your taste, Dependable cameras, Goodness of snapdragon 665, good battery backup enough to last throughout the day, also has type-C charging port., Overall a good buy, recent mobile are always out of stock, however this was a very good alternative and dont regret buying it. Its performance is comparable to recently launched moto g9, nokia 5.3, redmi 9 prime, realme narzo.
"
"
  The phone has a lot of specifications and one of the best phone in this range. The thing which makes it special is its battery and processor. The snapdragon 660 and 5000mah the perfect combination for every normal user. The camera is not good while comparing to the other high end devices but its manageable. Loved this phone it is whole white and looks lavish.
"
"
  So I bought this phone for my Dad. Initially I had a budget of 12k and I was considering to buy Redmi 9 prime but it sells out almost immediately and offline it costs 2k more, After a bit of research I found this phone to be relevant and Cheaper., Performance is smooth as it has sd665 and battery life is great considering hd+ and 5000mah battery., Honestly I don't find a great deal of quality difference in terms of screen resolution as I myself use k20 pro which has FHd+ panel., It comes with Android 9 but it can be updated to Oreo in system updates, Few things which you may dislike are:, A lot of crap apps some can be uninstalled and others can't., Camera performance (comparing from k20 pro perspective) is very average, 4 cameras mostly useless Ultrawide can be of a little use though, Few things I liked are, Plastic build is good and I personally liked it, Comes with a pretty good back case. Which my Dad is using from starting so it saved 200-300 rupees, Type C charging is good, Size is great and light weight too
"
"
  Ordered on 26.7.2020, Received on 28.7.2020, Phone looks Good, considering the price range and when compared to other phones in this segment, it looks simple and elegant., Not a fan of color os., Installed a launcher, atleast to look somewhat like stock android., Display quality is ok., Speakers are awesome ( stereo speakers )., Battery life seems to be sceptical., Will update after a few days
"
"
  Very disappointed with the product, I have been using it for over a month now. It has severe heating issues no matter what you do. I face heating issues while I'm charging or I'm on a call or even if I'm surfing basic internet. If you use the camera the phone heats up so much that you feel it would blast on your face. I'm genuinely scared of the product and planning to buy another phone. I tried getting help from the service center but they won't respond to any logical reasoning and I've been denied basic customer rights. It charges very slow and once it starts heating it discharges quickly. Once I didn't use the phone for hours but it still felt like it will burst of the heat that it was generating. Would not recommend buy it, complete waste of money.

  This mobile phone Oppo A5 2020 is very good , it has almost all features , the battery running fine , both the cameras are good , display is average , Wi-Fi calling is working fine . Overall the phone is good for this price range , I recommend this phone , great, go for it .....
"
"
  I thought OPPO will be a good choice...But except camera , nothing is good in this phone...The phone is much slower on internet compared to my previous phone....sometimes you hv to wait a lot to open site with high speed internet connection,  while other phones are much faster in same internet speed.Also keypads are problematic. Many a times you press one alphabet isctyped and will found different alphabet is typed..need lot of correction after typing..don't know, why it's happening...not a good phone at all..Don't buy it..
"
"
  Hey Amazon, this time I fell cheated by you, low quality product by oppo, if possible please change the product with other brand,, With regards, Waiting for reply,,,,
"
"
  I heard all the negative review but I guess it differs in my case it works well and the camera quality is good. It's definitely value your money.
"
"
  Works as expected. The screen is visible in sunlight and not subject to odd behavior (the problem we faced with the earlier Xiaomi. The battery life is good and charging is USB-C - hopefully sturdier than the flimsy micro-USB. Looks nice. Great download speeds. Color OS is closer to the android experience than MiUI (which we found terrible). Seems to use better hardware than my earlier phone. Happy I switched brands. Oppo costs slightly more - but you more than makeup with a quality product. Recommended.
"
"
  One of worst product ever seen,app cloner(dual app)is present but simultaneously maximum 2 app are use,fast charger is Not present as well as battery service is not good according to instructions by Oppo,Many more problem is present to this phone,I suggest you to not buy this phone at 12000 because there are many more options are available at this price
"
"
  The product is not up to the mark what it commits and says. Also the Product does not come with Ear Phones. Its either they r removed or not given with the Phone. This was 1st and Last time i have bought a phone from Amazon and would not suggest people to buy it from any of the Online site visit a shop and take it as per your preference and seeing the product.
"
"
  The phone is good. But camera quality is very poor. Please oppo sovle ta camera quality by giving us software updates. Price is slightly overpriced. battery of the phone is really noticable. But again camera is not good as described.
"
"
  1. Phones design perfect., 2. Fingerprint reader and face unlock is fast., 3. Audio quality awesome., 4. Lot of required and important features., 5. 44GB space present in 64GB., 6. Updated to Android 10 also., 7. Camera decent enough under 11,000 but there is no nightscape mode choice in camera app in 3GB RAM but captures good picture in dark., 8. Processor is also good., 9. Battery takes almost 3hr to charge from 0 to 100% but long lasting backup., 10. Good for multitasking and multimedia but not for heavy gaming users., 11. A great choice under 11,000 but if price more than that than you have lot of other good choices.

  Not even a month and the phone has problems. Screen is on and finger print reader, volume rocker and power not responding. Screen is unable to respond as well. Screen do not detect any touches. Regretting the purchase and sellers are clever enough to not to include a return more than 1 week from purchase.
"
"
  The phone is as mentioned. the fingerprint reader works fine and camera quality is wonderful and the best thing is battery life no complaints there.., When I ordered this phone I had doubts about the phone like what if I receive damaged phone or with issue..but that doesn't happen... I'm perfectly satisfied with the purchase!!!

   So good product it supports 4K camera video and photos 720 p full HD and 4k it supports. Battery life is good two day battery life. But for charging full  for 2and half hour it will take.I like it sooooo much after Redmi 7.redmi 7 is not good in privacy and camera.So I buy this phone

  Hello, This review I am giving after using phn for almost 3 month,, 1)It is very good phn in this price range,, 2) it has very good finger print sensor, 3) its processor is good No lag found till now, 4) camera is not good but it is ok for this price, 5) battery life is good but after continuous use or gaming it get hot, 6) over all this phn is good in this price range compare to redmi, Vivo, samsung

  first time ordered an OPPO phone. quite impressed by its features and specs. True to its specs, phone is working great, good battery life, looks amazing. I ordered a white white. The best part is that i received a silicon cover and a set of earphones with it included in the cost Rs.11,999/- as these we never get earphones in the box. I like the phone, may be 6 months down the line, i will buy another oppo replacing my xiomi.
"
"
  Very heavy phone, stutters slightly when scrolling and TOO MUCH BLOATWARE! Annoying! If this crap continues in the future I will only buy Android-One or iPhone. It's gotten completely ridiculous. Clean up Oppo!
"
"
  Dont buy any it.. camera blurred or take much attention during selfi.... cheat specs.
"
"
  I was tried Redmi 9 on flash sales but no luck and I hated flash sale :) I bought this phone but no regret, it works as expected I liked., Other notes: little heavier (weight), oppo has unwanted apps which we can't uninstall them.
"
"
  All Ok with price 10990, But back panel is doesn't look too black it shines a lot with polished glass and lots of possibilities of straches if you are not using back cover then your mobile becomes damn old..... more over oppo occupies a lot of space in internal storage due to themes , software..etc...,  Over All good and takes upto 3hr charging time quite disappointing for Type C , looks bulky but standard mobile best exchange value ,Lasts up to 3-6years depends upon the user👍
"
"
  Genuinely, It's useless camera phone even normal photos can't good, Horryble camera front camera 8mp can't capture better than my 2018 model MI y2, Also very slow due to 3gb ram., battery good all day backup 5000mAh, Colour & Display is good, Overall better to go for xiomi at this price point, if you have budget get f series they perform better, Have you get some help.
"
"
  Country of origin is not India., This is made in China phone.

  Good phone in this price segment, quad cam , big battery, video stabilization, what more can u expect from a budget device., Reviewing after one day of use..., Battery - 8/10, Camera - 8/10, Overall - 8/10, No heating till now, works smooth, no lagging, overall a decent phone...
"
"
  It would be a great phone if it have full hd display yes it contains 720p resolution which is old in model, Other spped and hardware is okey for this device, I have owned Xiaomi mobiles recently so i don't like its software as Xiaomi offers very easy excess to their apps but it doesn't
"
"
  Good value for money. Bought in Amazon big billion sale for my Mom getting good value for an old product and she's totally loving it., I was also looking for Samsung M30s but it doesn't have any screen protection and also it failed in one of the drop test. Moreover there was no good deal for exchanging on the same so had to go with this. And trust me using 1st time oppo, I wouldn't regret it.
"
"
  Fingerprint is slow and the smoothness of the screen is quite slow rest day to day performance is good not good for gaming just a entry level processor still does the basic jobs well, Battery life is amazing almost 8+ hours of sot but very very slow charging due to 10watt don't know if it supports 18 watt or not, Camera is decent in lit environment low light quality is below average, Sound quality is quite good due to dual speakers, Rest os is neat and clean no major problems noted
"
"
  I bought it for my Mom, we all know how our mom's use phone. They can easily spend a day or two by just simply looking at forwarded videos of their respective groups and surfing through fb. Hence my focus was to buy a long kasting battery life phone and I am happy to buy this one. Stunning performance, amazing camera. Processor is very fast and responds quickly as per the needs for which it was purchased. A perfect lower mid range phone.
"
"
  Pathetic...., This phone doesn't even support normal usage and hangs like anything., Pls don't buy this, as after just 2 month of purchase this phone started lagging for no reason., I'm not a heavy user, neither I play games on ph nor I use heavy apps still this ph hangs.
"
"
  I got this phone from your website on 24th August 2020  it's been 34 days only that I am using it., The issue that I am facing after 10 days of use- it hangs a lot, Secondly today on 29th Aug it's display turned out like showing in the pictures with this review., I don't want to go to the service center in this pandemic it's 60kms away from my home., Kindly replace this phone asap., I am hoping for the positive response from you.

  Excellent mobile phone with great features. Sound is awesome. Zumbo Battery backup but camera is average not better.

  i bought it with exchange of my old phone, so the price was reasonable for 4gb ram 128gb rom specs with snapdragon processor. few points.... 1. battery charges slowly(around 3hrs for full charge) but runs for more than 1 day with wifi, mobile data, gps, videos and other functions, 2. touch response is ok.... 3. not using it for gaming so without gaming no lags... 4. display is normal.... 5.  camera is ok....., overall good phone for normal usage not for gaming

  We need to know what is the capacity of SD  memory.and the phone. What is normally used IN OPPO A5? Also recharge display is not constant cannon read the micro figures.

  writing this review after two months of usage:Great phone at this price,but don't think massive battery lasts for 2 to3 days,it lasts for only 1 day.Camera is good for this price, finger print is too fast, front camera is average,display is good for this segment, charging takes moe than 2hr30 min to full charge,better than vivo at this price segment,processor is doing it's job well for games., Over all a good phone🙂🙂

  The best value phone at this price. I was sceptical about its camera quality..but the camera clicks decent pictures. I exchanged my xiomi redmi 7A and got it for 7200.

  I really don't have good experience with oppo phone, sometime I feel realme phone is much more better than oppo, oppo need to focus on customer experience, otherwise they will simply vanish in coming few years.

  The Battery life is wonderful, it last's two day's in standard use, no gaming. The UI lag's some times, but I can tolerate that, but when it comes to the both side camera's it's avarage, not a good one and also absolutely not a better one !! Details are so low!!!! But other things are good. Considering the price point it's a avarage choise.
"

  The product is very bad. It hangs a lot and I have bought 1 month ago. I can't imagine so dirty product in terms of phone lag., I would recommend no one to buy this phone., I want replacement for this phone at any cost, It would be great OPPO can replace my phone as I have purchased recently one month ago., They have fooled us badly.

  As I heard of, that Oppo phone near are good,same I found, Tough quality with white color..apprantly seems unique, Fast charging support, 5000 mah charged in 1 hour+ time., C type pin never fails or damage, - it is my one day review only, but looking it is best phone I purchased..
